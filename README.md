#### ToDo Application
This project aims to create a ToDo application from scratch using the following technologies:

- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java applications.
- PostgreSQL: A robust relational database management system.
- JPA Data: Java Persistence API for working with databases in a standardized way.
- JSP: JavaServer Pages for building dynamic web pages.
- The application will allow users to manage their tasks, including creating, updating, and deleting them. It will leverage - --- Spring Boot's features and JPA Data for seamless database operations. The PostgreSQL database will store the task data securely.

By following this project, I will do set up a Spring Boot application, integrate it with PostgreSQL, utilize JPA Data for database operations, and build dynamic web pages with JSP. It will serve as a comprehensive example of creating a ToDo application using modern technologies.
